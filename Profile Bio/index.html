                            Daniel has a weak temporomandibular joint due to dislocating his jaw as a b-boy dancer. Because of this, his jaw often makes a popping sound.<br>
<br>
He beats stress by playing games, doing lower body bathing, listening to music, and dancing. When he can’t sleep, he watches his own fancams.<br>
<br>
His mom’s conception dream was a jewel in the night sky like a galaxy pouring onto her. During his doljanchi, which is a Korean “fortune telling” tradition celebrated during a baby’s first birthday, Daniel grabbed a pencil. The pencil (one of usually 6 or 8 objects put in a table for the baby to grab) symbolizes that the child is destined to be smart!<br>
<br>
On August 2011, Daniel participated in the dance competition Busan City Kids Vol.2 with a b-boy friend and won the final. Other idols that participated in the same competition were fellow Wanna One teammate, Park Woojin, and BTS’s Park Jimin.<br>
<br>
His first two cats, Rooney the orange tabby cat (named after Wayne Rooney, a soccer player) and Peter the calico cat (named after Peter Parker/Spiderman), are actually females and former stray cats. Daniel’s younger cats are an Abyssinian named Ori (Korean for “Duck” which is the name of the cat on the Constantine movie) brought shortly after International Cat Day 2018 and a white Ragdoll named Zhang-Ah who is currently the youngest.<br>
<br>
Daniel is known for being a huge cat lover. He often times uses cat memes and shares photos of his own cats in the official Wanna One fancafe. When asked during a fansign what breed he would want to be if he was a cat, Daniel said he would want to be an Abyssinian. As for a super power he would like to have, Daniel chose to be able to communicate with cats. His room during Wanna One Go: Zero Base was also cat themed.<br>
<br>
During his time as a trainee, Daniel appeared on MBC Every1 Her Secret Weapon, where he performed Uhm Jung-hwa’s “Invitation” as a backup dancer to Fiestar’s Cao Lu and Spica’s Sihyun. Also during this time, Daniel said he didn’t visit his hometown for holidays because he didn’t want to meet his family before achieving something.<br>
<br>
For his Produce 101 Season 2 unaired individual evaluation, Daniel did a dance break and sang “Sometimes (가끔)” by Crush. And among the three group evaluations during the show, Daniel considers “Open Up” as his legendary stage.<br>
<br>
If he was given the opportunity to act in the future, Daniel mentioned he would like to play a bossy CEO or a lawyer.<br>
<br>
Daniel said his nickname during school was soft persimmon since he was naive and tenderhearted.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="text-4">
            <p class="paragraph">Daniel was born as Kang Euigeon (강의건) on December 10, 1996 in the coastal city of Busan as the only child of his family. After spending his childhood up to adolescence with his birth name, he later decided to legally change his name due to his family and friends having difficulties pronouncing Euigeon, thus adopting his current name Daniel, with a <span style="color:orange;">biblical hero</span> as the source of his inspiration.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">During Daniel’s childhood, his family went through financial problems after a business his father ran failed, and they were forced to move into a basement for a week. On the March 22, 2018 episode of MBC’s show Radio Star, Daniel was asked about his habit of smelling things. He revealed he had a trauma from the time he lived in that basement commenting, “The bathroom was right next to the room. The smell of mold and sewer was disgusting, and I smelled it while eating. I became sensitive to smells after that.” Some time later his parents divorced, and Daniel was raised by his mother on her own.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-5">
            <p class="paragraph">Although dancing is currently his passion, Daniel actually started dancing as a medium for self-healing. On September 4, 2017 during an appearance on KBS Hello Counselor, Daniel revealed that he was bullied in middle school due to his looks. It was then when his teacher suggested he start dancing, and this became a medium for him to cope with the problem and build his self-esteem. In KBS Sketchbook, he shared joining the b-boy club also happened by coincidence since he was planning to join the magic or reading club but missed the opportunity to sign up due to falling asleep. To pursue his passion in dancing, Daniel attended Peniel International High School of the Arts where he majored in modern dance and also Nataraja Academy (나타라자 아카데미), a dance academy in Busan. As a teenager, he was also active in the b-boying community in his hometown and used to perform under the name 
            <span style="color:orange;">FLAC</span>.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Setting his dream to become an idol, Daniel decided to move to Seoul and start a life full of uncertainty as a trainee. For a while, he was a trainee under B2M<br>Entertainment until management separation and later moved under MMO Entertainment. During this training period, Daniel had almost given up on his dream<br>due to the problems faced by his agency. The company was very lacking in facilities, as it was only a house with an underground practice room. It also<br>struggled financially and hence could not afford dance or singing lessons, forcing Daniel to learn them by himself. He lived in a goshiwon since his company did<br>not provide housing or meals. At that time, Daniel thought that he would never get a chance to debut and planned to move to Canada where his aunt lives.<br>However, just before that, a sudden opportunity came by, and he decided to give it one last try.</p>

              In early 2021, KONNECT Entertainment announced Kang Daniel would feature in a single produced by American artist Inverness called “State of Wonder,” alongside producer and singer Anthony Russo. Both of them had previously worked with Daniel in his album MAGENTA. Shortly after the release of “State of Wonder” on January 15, teasers for Kang Daniel’s official comeback were released at the beginning of February. A week later, KONNECT released the digital single’s cover image and described “PARANOIA” as a new turning point. 

The digital single “PARANOIA” was released on February 16 to much praise and commercial success. The single gave Kang Daniel his first entry at #5 on Billboard’s World Digital Song Sales chart,[s] and debuted at #2 in the Gaon digital chart, making it his highest charting song to date. During his appearance on MBC’s program Radio Star, Daniel said he wrote “PARANOIA” when he was on hiatus in 2019 due to mental and physical health issues, so the song is very dark. The song expressed his paranoia that he might harm himself. He confessed he lost his will to live but overcame his condition after being inspired by other artists.[s] [s] In this sense KBS news reporter Jeong Ji-eun praised the song saying, “I would like to applaud Kang Daniel for releasing the darkest part of himself with talent in order to give strength to someone who may have a similar heartache.”[s] About the music video, Elle Korea wrote in an article, “The music video for ‘PARANOIA’ is not just a music video for showing. You can feel his complex feelings and sincerity. Isn’t this the reason why many people can relate to it?”[s]

In April, the fancafe mobile application was officially made available, and the website was redesigned. Daniel released his third mini album YELLOW on April 13 with “Antidote” as its lead single. He topped the weekly Gaon digital, download, BGM, and album charts, earning a quadruple crown. Daniel took home five music show trophies, including his first Inkigayo win as a solo artist on the last day of music show promotions. On April 29, Dalcom Soft launched the SuperStar KANGDANIEL mobile rhythm game app. This is the first time a SuperStar series was created exclusively for a solo artist. On May 13, the UNIVERSE MUSIC single “Outerspace” with LOCO was released. In July 2021, Daniel was confirmed to be the MC of Mnet’s first female dance crew competition show Street Woman Fighter and part of the Cyworld BGM 2021 remake lineup. KONNECT would also be partnering with CL’s Very Cherry to manage her domestic activities. For Daniel’s second year since debut anniversary, KONNECT prepared a 24-hour virtual reality fanmeeting titled DAN2TY& and other online activities.[s] [s] In addition, Chancellor and GFRIEND’s YUJU were announced as KONNECT artists in August and September. Daniel features in J-rockstar MIYAVI’s sixth track “Hush Hush” from his September 15 album Imaginary.
